# Assignment
A game prototype for a balloon inflation and burst mechanic created as part of an assignment. The game allows players to inflate a balloon using an air pump, make it fly in random directions, and burst it on tap. Developed using Phaser.js, this project demonstrates the basic implementation of game physics and interactive mechanics.
